# Pipeline-Zillow
This repository outlines the data pipeline for all Zillow data.  

All data is stored in a SQLite database called Zillow that is located in the "Outputs" folder. A guide to this database called "DB_Zillow_Metadata.xlsx" is located in the "Outputs" folder and should be updated whenever a new data series is added or altered.  

Data Products Currently in the Pipeline Include:  
+ Annual Home Value Index   
+ Annual Rental Index  

Note that these are updated frequently so in the metadata record the latest update every time along with the latest data month available per update.
